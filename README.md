# `Typescript Training`

## 1. usage

If you are in this folder, then check which example you want to run, then in this folder:

- run `yarn` to install management dependencies.
- run `yarn install` to install all the sub-example dependencies.
- `yarn [exampleFolderName]` or `npm run [exampleFolderName]`. eg, `yarn reduxToolkitTrain` or `npm run reduxToolkitTrain` will start the `example/reduxToolkitTrain` example.

You can also go into each example folder and follow the README in each folders to start the example.
